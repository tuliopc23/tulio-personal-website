On Apple devices, the `-apple-system` face maps to the **San Francisco** family. Prefer the system stack instead of self-hosting SFâ€”it's consistent with platform typography and avoids licensing pitfalls.

```css
:root {
  --font-sans:
    -apple-system, system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial,
    "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji";
}
```
