Appleâ€™s **materials** create separation and depth using translucency and blur. On the web, you can simulate this with a semi-opaque surface, `backdrop-filter: blur()`, and a crisp hairline border.

```css
.card {
  background: color-mix(in oklch, var(--surface) 70%, transparent);
  border: 1px solid var(--hairline);
  backdrop-filter: blur(18px);
}
```

Keep elevation subtle, emphasize **content**, and ensure contrast is sufficient in both light and dark modes.
