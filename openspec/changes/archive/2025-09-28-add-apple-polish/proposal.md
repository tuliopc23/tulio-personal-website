## Why

The website has excellent foundational design and functionality, but lacks the subtle polish and purposeful micro-interactions that define Apple's design language. These enhancements will add the restrained elegance and functional beauty that Apple is known for - subtle hover states, smooth transitions, and clean interactions that feel effortless.

## What Changes

- **Homepage**: Subtle card hover states, clean profile enhancements, smooth transitions
- **Blog**: Clean filter transitions, reading progress, subtle status indicators
- **Projects**: Gentle hover effects, clean status badges, consistent grid layout
- **Cross-page**: Smooth scroll behavior, clean focus indicators, subtle loading states

## Impact

- Affected specs: homepage, blog, projects, visual-polish
- Affected code: `src/pages/`, `src/components/`, `src/styles/`, `src/scripts/`
- User experience: Authentic Apple-like polish, improved accessibility, functional elegance
- Performance: Optimized transitions, lazy loading, smooth scroll behavior
