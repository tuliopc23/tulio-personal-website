## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Refresh mobile and tablet typography/spacing tokens with clamp-based scales in `src/styles/theme.css`.
- [x] 1.2 Rework card grids (homepage recent posts, projects, uses) to become horizontal carousels on â‰¤720px viewports while keeping desktop layouts.
- [x] 1.3 Improve mobile navigation/sidebar behavior (sticky CTA or drawer) and add touch-target feedback.
- [x] 1.4 Ensure images/icons lazy-load and size correctly to prevent overflow on small screens.
- [x] 1.5 Run `bun run check` plus manual device spot-checks, updating spec validation.
