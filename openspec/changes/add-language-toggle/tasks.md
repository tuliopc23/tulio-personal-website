## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Scaffold locale dictionaries (en, pt-BR) for shared UI strings and add an i18n context/provider.
- [ ] 1.2 Build the segmented language toggle in the top bar styled per Apple HIG, persisting selection locally.
- [ ] 1.3 Replace hard-coded strings in key surfaces (nav, hero, projects/blog headings, buttons) with locale lookups.
- [ ] 1.4 Ensure accessibility (ARIA roles, focus states, announcements) and add tests/manual QA steps.

## 2. Validation

- [ ] 2.1 Run `bun run check` and verify both language variants across desktop/mobile.
