## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Gather project metadata (title, summary, role, stack, external link) and choose storage (temporary JSON or upcoming CMS) for card rendering.
- [ ] 1.2 Build `src/pages/projects.astro` using existing card components, matching spacing/typography tokens and adding a lead section that explains the portfolio.
- [ ] 1.3 Ensure cards support optional badges (e.g., in progress, case study) and responsive carousel behavior â‰¤720px while keeping multi-column grids on desktop.
- [ ] 1.4 Add SEO metadata (title/description/open graph) and ensure each project link opens in a new tab with analytics hooks ready.
- [ ] 1.5 Run `bun run check`, document manual testing (desktop + mobile), and update OpenSpec validation.
